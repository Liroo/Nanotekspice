# Nanotekspice

This is our first real project using c++ at Epitech.

> There's no such word as can't

### Main goal

We had to create electric components such as input, output, clock, 4008, etc... and a module to simulation them.

### How we do this ?

- We parsed the file of configuration, we created a AST such as we can transform him easily in custom tree with custom components and we launch a CLI.

- Basicly the CLI got customs command such as 'simulate', 'display', 'loop', etc...

- The CLI launched with simulate and display.

- There is many features on our project: 'Ncurses', 'many tests', 'additional commands', etc...
